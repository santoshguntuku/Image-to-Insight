Image to Insight: The "Meme" Analyzer 🖼️ ➡️ 📊

Track: Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Computer Vision (CV)

Duration: 5 Weeks

Mentor: Santosh and Lakshaditya

🚀 Project Overview

Have you ever pondered the meaning behind all those memes, screenshots, and social media posts? "Image to Insight" is a hands-on journey into Multimodal AI. You will build a pipeline that allows your program to "see" an image and "read" the hidden sentiment behind it.

By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional web application that takes a meme as input, extracts the text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and analyzes the humor/sentiment using NLP (Natural Language Processing).
🏗️ How This Project Works (Hub & Spoke Model)

This repository acts as the Central Hub.

Resources: I will release guides, datasets, and starter code here every Monday.

Assignments: You will check this repo for your weekly tasks.

Submission: You will not push code here. You must fork this repo or create your own public repository named Image_to_Insight_YourName and upload your work there.

🛠️ Prerequisites & Setup

You don't need a powerful laptop. We will use Google Colab for the heavy lifting. However, you should install the necessary libraries locally for the final weeks.

Installation: pip install -r requirements.txt

Required Libraries:
• easyocr (Vision)
• textblob (Language)
• streamlit (Web App)
• pillow (Image Processing)
• opencv-python-headless (CV Utilities)

🏁 Getting Started
1. Star this repository to keep track of updates.
2. Create your own repository.
3. Go to the Week_1 folder (linked above) to begin your first assignment!
