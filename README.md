Image to Insight: The "Meme" Analyzer 🖼️ ➡️ 📊

Track: Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Computer Vision (CV)

Duration: 5 Weeks

Mentor: Santosh and Lakshaditya

🚀 Project Overview

Have you ever pondered the meaning behind all those memes, screenshots, and social media posts? "Image to Insight" is a hands-on journey into Multimodal AI. You will build a pipeline that allows your program to "see" an image and "read" the hidden sentiment behind it.

By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional web application that takes a meme as input, extracts the text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and analyzes the humor/sentiment using NLP (Natural Language Processing).
